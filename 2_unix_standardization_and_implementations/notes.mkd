c99 is the interface to the C compilation environment.
Set the feature test macros (`_POSIX_C_SOURCE`, `_XOPEN_SOURCE`) to compile a program so that it only depends on the POSIX and XSI definitions.
(700 is for Version 4 of the Single UNIX Specification (2008 edition of POSIX.1), 600 for Version 3 (2001 edition))
```
gcc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 -std=c99 file.c -o file.out
```

to check conf without writing a C program:
```
getconf _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL
```
